<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
 In my 2023 IT home lab, I installed Peppermint as a ticketing system and get myself familiar with what would a help desk technician look like. Creating tickets,
 leaving a note, and adding clients' information. Linode is an IT Linux cloud company and I use their service to run my personal Peppermint.
