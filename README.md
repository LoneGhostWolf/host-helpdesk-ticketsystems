<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
 In my 2023 IT home lab, I installed Peppermint as a ticketing system and get myself familiar with this tool of how a Helpdesk Technician's work looks like. I learned to create and close a ticket, write a note on the incident case, and add a client to the internal database. Linode is an IT Linux cloud company and I use their service to run the online ticketing system on the website.
